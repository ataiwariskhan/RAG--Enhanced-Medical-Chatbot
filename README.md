# RAG--Enhanced-Medical-Chatbot
# 🩺 RAG-Enhanced Medical Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot designed to assist users with medical information and guidance. This project combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with a retrieval mechanism to provide reliable, context-aware, and accurate responses instead of relying purely on the model’s parametric memory.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This chatbot is built for educational and research purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a certified doctor for actual medical concerns.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Medical Q&A: Users can ask health-related questions in natural language.

✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Fetches relevant information from medical datasets / knowledge base before generating responses.

✅ Context-aware answers: Ensures responses are aligned with trusted medical sources.

✅ Minimal hallucination: RAG reduces chances of LLM producing incorrect medical facts.

✅ Interactive Chat Interface (via Streamlit/Notebook).

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

# 🏗️ System Architecture

User Query → Entered via chat interface

Embedding Generation → Query converted into vector form

Retriever (FAISS/Chroma) → Finds most relevant medical documents

LLM Response Generation → Model generates answer using retrieved context

Final Answer → Sent back to user in conversational format

User Input → Embedding Model → Vector Store → Retriever → LLM → Response

# 📂 Dataset / Knowledge Source

Supports addition of custom datasets (JSON, CSV, or text files).y

# 📊 Example Queries

“What are the symptoms of diabetes?”

“Can high blood pressure be controlled naturally?”

“What is the normal range for hemoglobin?”

# 🔮 Future Improvements
